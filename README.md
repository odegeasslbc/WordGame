# wordGame
a simple word game, good for a group of friends play together

a game in party

in this game,every one sit in a circleï¼Œand there are two words,the two word have simler meanings but with several differences.all the person will be given a number in turn and one of the two word randomly,there will be a spy given the word that differ from everyone rest,but no one know who is the spy and whether the word they get is differ from others' word.And then,everyone have to describe their word,after one round,they will vote for who is the spy,if they find out the spy,the spy loss,if they not,the one they vote for is out and they continue the next round of descriptions,if there are only 2 or 3 person left after several rounds,the spy win.

In the code part,I find out some features amoune self.loadView() and self.viewdidload().I do not know what others do, when I want to restart the game,I just call a self.loadView(),and write the layout and what I want in this function.

In this time,I learn to add some animations in the UI part.
